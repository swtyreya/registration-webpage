This registration website allows users to create an account by filling in a simple form with username, email, and password with its validation or requirements. It provides instant feedback for errors or success, includes a reset button to clear inputs, and supports light/dark mode for better viewing. Additionally, it features a small interactive section that demonstrates event bubbling and capturing for learning purposes with the use of buttons to show and hide those features.
